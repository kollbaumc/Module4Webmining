"Don't worry, I won't hurt you\nI only want you to have some fun\n\nI was dreamin' when I wrote this\nForgive me if it goes astray\nBut when I woke up this mornin'\nCould've sworn it was judgment day\n\nThe sky was all purple\nThere were people runnin' everywhere\nTryin' to run from the destruction\nYou know I didn't even care\n\nSay say\nTwo-thousand-zero-zero party over\nOops out of time\nSo tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999\n\n(I was dreaming' when I wrote this)\n(So sue me if I go too fast)\n(Life is just a party, and parties weren't meant to last)\nWar is all around us, my mind says prepare to fight\nSo if I gotta die I'm gonna listen to my body tonight\nYeah\n\nThey say two-thousand-zero-zero party over\nOops out of time\nSo tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999\nYeah, Yeah\n\nLemme tell ya something\nIf you didn't come to party\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409622896326)"
