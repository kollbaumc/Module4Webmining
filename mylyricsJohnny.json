"Love is a burning thing\nAnd it makes a fiery ring\nBound by wild desire\nI fell into a ring of fire\n\nI fell into a burning ring of fire\nI went down, down, down\nAnd the flames went higher\nAnd it burns, burns, burns\nThe ring of fire, the ring of fire\n\nI fell into a burning ring of fire\nI went down, down, down\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409622896326)"
