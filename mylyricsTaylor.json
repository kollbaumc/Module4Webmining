"This ain't for the best\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\nYou must like me for me\n\nWe can't make any promises\nNow can we, babe?\nBut you can make me a drink\n\nDive bar on the East Side, where you at?\nPhone lights up my nightstand in the black\nCome here; you can meet me in the back\n\nDark jeans and your Nikes, look at you\nOh, damn, never seen that color blue\nJust think of the fun things we could do\n'Cause I like you\n\nThis ain't for the best\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\nYou must like me for me\nYeah, I want you\n\nWe can't make any promises\nNow can we, babe?\nBut you can make me a drink\n\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\n\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409622896326)"
