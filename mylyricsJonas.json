"We go together\nBetter than birds of a feather, you and me\nWe change the weather, yeah\nI'm feeling heat in December when you're 'round me\n\nI've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars\nI follow you through the dark, can't get enough\nYou're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain\nAnd, baby, you know it's obvious\n\nI'm a sucker for you\nSay the word and I'll go anywhere blindly\nI'm a sucker for you, yeah\nAny road you take, you know that you'll find me\nI'm a sucker for all the subliminal things\nNo one knows about you, about you, about you, about you\nAnd you're making the typical me, break my typical rules\nIt's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409622896326)"
